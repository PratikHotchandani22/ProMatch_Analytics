Analyze the following inputs:  
- `resume_text`: [Insert resume text]  
- `job_description_text`: [Insert job description text]  
- `rag_text`: [Insert RAG text, if any]  

Perform the following tasks step-by-step:  

### 1. Technical Keyword Analysis  
- Extract technical keywords from `job_description_text` and compare them with the skills section in `resume_text`.  
- Identify only the missing keywords that are not present in the skills section of `resume_text`.  
- Suggest where these missing keywords should be added, providing a list formatted as:  
  - **Skills Section Additions**:  
    - [Missing Skill 1]: Add under [sub-section, if applicable].  
    - [Missing Skill 2]: Add under [sub-section, if applicable]. 

Give only missing keywords in response.

### 2. Skill, Experience, and Responsibility Gap Analysis  
- Identify skills, experiences, or responsibilities mentioned in `job_description_text` that are not present in `resume_text`.  

---

### 3. Best Suggestions from RAG Data (if applicable)  
- If `rag_text` is provided, review its `text` values grouped by `category` and `title`. Group all texts under the same `category` and `title` as follows:  
  - **[Category] - [Title]**:  
    - [Grouped RAG text values]

  - "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]."  

- Ensure each statement:  
  1. **Includes quantifiable metrics**: Specify measurable impacts like percentages (e.g., "20% improvement"), reductions (e.g., "40% reduction"), or absolute figures (e.g., "100K+ dataset").  
  2. **Is concise**: Limit each statement to one line, avoiding unnecessary repetition or wordiness.  
  3. **Highlights technical expertise**: Name tools, methods, or frameworks used (e.g., Databricks, Pinecone, OpenAI).  
  4. **Uses actionable verbs**: Start statements with strong action verbs like "Enhanced," "Created," "Streamlined," or "Optimized."  
  5. **Focuses on impact**: Clearly articulate the result or value added (e.g., improved performance, reduced costs, or increased efficiency).  

- Align each statement with real experiences or achievements from `resume_text` and `rag_text`. Ensure the final points stand out to technical reviewers by being clear, impactful, and results-driven.
